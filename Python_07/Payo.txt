Payo by Shel Silverstein

Payo loves me,
Payo cares,
Payo picks me peaches and pears.
Payo offers me candy and Cokes,
Payo listens and laughs at me jokes.
Payo helps when I get in a fight,
Payo does all my homework at night.
Payo misses me,
Payo cries,
Payo thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Payo is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Payo just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Payo's hand,
In the darkness where Payo usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Payo's gone!
